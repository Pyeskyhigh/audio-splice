SoundSlice
===================================

SoundSlice is a library meant to read in an audio file in any of several supported formats which are listed below, and identify different speakers. This library has the capacity to flag speaker switches and split the audio file into two different speakers (one containing all the parts of each speaker).

This library will also include a visualization software which will draw out the array of bytes to simplify analysis.

Supported Audio Formats (as of now)
--------

  * MIDI
  * .wav
